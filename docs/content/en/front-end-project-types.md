WB-Starter creates the scaffolding for Vue.js-based projects. Different files are created based on what project template you choose during the installation step.

All front-end projects are based on Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and a set of framework-agnostic Vue components. ESLint is included and Webpack is configured with aliases to make development easier.
