WB-Starter
==========

My personal framework for front-end development includes some SASS, HTML, and JS snippets that I use on a regular basis. This framework is built using Node and Webpack and it is meant to be pulled apart or modified for the project at hand. By changing settings in the `package.json` file, this can be used for one-page landing pages, as well as used in full-fledged CMS themes.

This is here for my own storage, but please [let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions](https://github.com/wbrowar/WB-Starter/issues).

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (requires v11+)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) (for Craft-based projects)

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/wbrowar/WB-Starter/wiki)
